"""002 LL Has Loop ( Interview Question)
Instructions
Write a method called has_loop that is part of the linked list class.

The method should be able to detect if there is a cycle or loop present in the linked list.

The method should utilize Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm, to determine the presence of a loop efficiently.

The method should follow these guidelines:



Create two pointers, slow and fast, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

Traverse the list with the slow pointer moving one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

If there is a loop in the list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. If this occurs, the method should return True.

If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list or encounters a None value, it means there is no loop in the list. In this case, the method should return False """

class Node:
    def __init__(self,value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self,value):
        newNode = Node(value)
        self.head = newNode
        self.tail = newNode
        self.length = 1

    def append(self,value):
        newNode = Node(value)
        if self.length == 0:
            self.head = newNode
            self.tail = newNode
        else:
            self.tail.next = newNode
            self.tail = newNode
        self.length+=1 
        return True

    def has_loop(self):
        slow = self.head 
        fast = self.head
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
